== Description ==

The plugin DigoWatchWP scans your blog posts and pages for changes.

Whenever an entry has been changed it informs you via email. So if you receive an email and you have nothing changed you should have a closer look at your post or page. Maybe somebody changed your post or page to include a spam-link (e.g. links to OnlineCasino, adult-content are very popular).

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you have likely already done this).
2. Upload the digowatchwp.php file to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click *Activate* for DigoWatchWP. This will create the database table used by DigoWatchWP.
4. Congratulations, you have just installed DigoWatchWP and it is now checking your posts and pages hourly.
5. Optional: go into Options > DigoWatchWP to modify some values

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How do I uninstall DigoWatchWP? =
Go back to you Plugins page, and click *Deactivate* for DigoWatchWP.

= What if I want to re-enable DigoWatchWP later? =
No problem. Go back to the Plugins page and click *Activate* for DigoWatchWP.

= I am using DigoWatchWP - does this mean my blog is now *protected*? =
No, DigoWatchWP cannot prevent that somebody uses bugs in your WordPress-Blog. It will just notice, that something has happened and your posts/pages have been changed and will inform you via Email.

= I am using DigoWatchWP - does this mean I do not have to update to the latest WordPress stable release? =
**NO**, you should always update your installation to the latest stable release as quick as possible.

= But why I should use DigoWatchWP? =
Well WordPress is great software, but you never know - software tends to be buggy and so there could be an unknown bug in the latest release. So it is always good that *someone* has a look at your posts/pages - DigoWatchWP does this job for you.

= DigoWatchWP emailed me, but I can not see any changes? =
Are you sure? Take a closer look by using the code-tab. Maybe you will find the spam-link within a noscript-tag - so you won´t see the link if you have javascript allowed.
